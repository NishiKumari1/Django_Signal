"""Yes, by default, Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller. This means if a signal is triggered within a transaction and the transaction is rolled back, the changes made within the signal and the caller will also be rolled back.

To demonstrate this, we will:

Use a signal receiver that modifies the database.
Simulate a rollback in the main function after the signal is triggered.
Prove that the changes made by both the signal and the main caller are rolled back when the transaction fails."""

"""Explanation:
We define a signal receiver user_saved that updates the username of the User instance to "updated_by_signal" after the user is saved.
In the save_user_with_rollback function, we create a new user within an atomic transaction block.
We simulate an error by raising an exception, which will cause a transaction rollback.
After the rollback, we check if the original user was created and if the signal's changes persisted.

Conclusion:
The signal updates the user's username, but since the transaction is rolled back due to the simulated exception, both the original user creation and the signal's changes are rolled back.
The final check shows that the user does not exist in the database, proving that Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller by default."""
